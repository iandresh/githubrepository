I am Andres Hurtado, I am from Venezuela and moved to miami when I was a kid
My career goal is to become a successful entrepreneur and build a social networking app where people earn money
I chose fintech as a career path because it will open a lot of doors in the future and these expertise will be needed in the coming future by huge companies.
